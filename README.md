# eloquent-enhanced
Love Laravel ? But stuck on a php 5.3 project and Laravel 4.1 ? Yes, this is my case, so I started to enhanced Eloquent to fit my needs. I'll put just put modifications here. 

I'll always try to extends original classes to be able to update easily Laravel later. But in some case it's not possible ...
